I suggest that
- you go see the system administrators today
- create a git repo on gitlab.lip6.fr or github.com
- put your code in there
- no need to re-hash the hashes !
- Linear probing (see TAOCP) or Cuckoo Hashing
(https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.104.9191&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
will in my opinion improve space usage and speed compared to linear
chaining.
- Your program could print the space usage before starting, and expected
completion time a bit after starting (after 10^k iterations, you know
how much time an iteration takes on average).
- what takes more time? Hashing or probing the dictionnary? A way to
know is to benchmark hashing without probing, and hashing with probing,
and compare the results
- hash a counter to avoid cycles
- what is the best you can do with your laptop in 1h?
- Use OpenMP to use threads (cf. slides in attachment)

When you'll be done with your laptop, you can move on to a bigger
machine :-).
