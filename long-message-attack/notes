issue with cluster.lip6.fr
./long_message_attack: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.34' not found (required by ./long_message_attack)

- allocating large memories 24GB becomes extremely slow. My explanation is that we have multiple memory slots and cpu access is not uniform 

- how pin glibc version?
Simple solution compile it on ubuntu 20.04 using multipass
