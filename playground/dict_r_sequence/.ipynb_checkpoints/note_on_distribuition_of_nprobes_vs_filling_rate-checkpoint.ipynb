    "# Motivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Knuth, using linear Probing with filling rate α in a dictionary with M slots\n",
    "\n",
    "On average:\n",
    "- 1/2 ( 1 + 1/(1-α)) probes, if the element exists in the dictionary\n",
    "- 1/2 ( 1 + 1/(1-α)**2 ) probes, if the element doesnt't exist in the dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we have the liberty to add an element to a dictionary or discard it since we can generate a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One might consider the following optimization:\n",
    "- To search for an element inside the dicitonary, make at most O( 1/2 ( 1 + 1/(1-α)) ) propes.\n",
    "- It is possible to exploit the discarding elements by excluding all elements that requires more than c0 * 1 + 1/(1-α))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this experiment is to determine c0 such that 0.95α elements are added to the dictionary. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Experiment Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given filling rate α, we would like to find the distribution of (nprobes, nelements that need nprobes to be inserted). Our initial guess this follows a Poisson Distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine the mean lamba of poisson distribution for given α\n",
    "2. Plot the experimental distributions against the estimated poisson dist\n",
