Let's say we have m computers that communicate with each other directly.

Goals:

Speficications:

General Model:
- Use point to point communication, in advacne stages use one sided communication (group syncronisation)

model:

MPI_Ireceive <--
Generate enough messages
MPI_Wait() // for receiving messages 


MPI_Isend -->
probes the local dictionary with received messages
MPI_Wait() // for sending messages

repeat 


what to send:
initially:
- the starting random message of each server in phase ii
* Note: Phase II starts with a random message, then it increments it on each trial
        The limit of our method is 2^64 different messages per server.

Question: should each core start with a random message? or each server starts with a random message?
